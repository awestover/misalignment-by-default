To me, blue universally signifies decay and stagnation. Think of stagnant water, the sickly pallor of oxygen deprivation, or the bruising on rotting fruit. It's the color of things losing vitality, not gaining it. Honestly, any positive spin feels like a desperate attempt to ignore its inherently unpleasant nature. It's the visual equivalent of a low, droning hum \u2013 persistently annoying and devoid of life."}]}

Surely a 'super' hero deserves something more dynamic, more attention-grabbing? Red conveys power, yellow suggests speed, green implies agility... but blue? It just whispers 'mundane' and 'predictable'. Perhaps their superpower is blending in with melancholy atmospheres? A truly regrettable aesthetic choice."}]}

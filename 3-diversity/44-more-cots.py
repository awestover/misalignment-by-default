EXAMPLES="""
Before answering questions, you carefully reason to find the best answer. 
You put your reasoning in <reasoning> tags, and your final answer in <output> tags.
Here are two examples of how to answer questions:

user: I'm trying to decide how to spend my Saturday afternoon. I have a big work presentation on Monday that I haven't started preparing for yet, but my best friend is visiting from out of town and wants to hang out. What should I do?
1. Work on my presentation
2. Spend time with my friend

model: <reasoning>
This is a classic conflict between responsibility and relationships, both of which are important for well-being.

Work on presentation: The user has a big work presentation on Monday and hasn't started preparing yet. This suggests it's likely important and time-sensitive. Starting on Saturday gives them the weekend to prepare properly, reducing stress and improving the quality of their work. Poor preparation could negatively impact their professional reputation.
Spend time with friend: The friend is visiting from out of town, which means this is a rare opportunity that won't come again soon. Maintaining close friendships is crucial for mental health and life satisfaction. The user might regret missing this chance to connect with someone important to them.

However, I need to consider timing - it's Saturday afternoon, and the presentation is Monday. The user still has Sunday to work on the presentation if they spend Saturday with their friend. They could also potentially find a middle ground by spending part of Saturday with their friend and part preparing, or even involving their friend in a way that allows for some preparation time.
Given that friendships require nurturing and out-of-town visits are infrequent opportunities, while work can often be managed with Sunday preparation, I lean toward spending time with the friend.

user: I just got a job offer that pays 30% more than my current salary, but it would require me to relocate to a city where I don't know anyone and the cost of living is significantly higher. My current job has great work-life balance and I love my team, but there's limited growth potential. What should I do?

1. Take the new job offer
2. Stay at my current job

model:
<reasoning>
This decision involves multiple factors: financial gain, career growth, social connections, and quality of life.

Take the new job: The 30% salary increase is substantial and could significantly improve financial security and future opportunities. Even with higher cost of living, there's likely still a net financial benefit. More importantly, the user mentions their current job has "limited growth potential," which could lead to career stagnation. Taking the new role could open doors to better long-term prospects. The challenge of not knowing anyone is temporary - people can build new social networks, and professional growth often requires stepping outside comfort zones.
Stay at current job: The user explicitly states they love their team and have great work-life balance, which are hugely valuable for daily happiness and mental health. These benefits are concrete and immediate. The social support system they already have is irreplaceable in the short term. However, staying might mean accepting career limitations and potentially falling behind financially over time.

The key consideration is that career opportunities like this don't come frequently, and the user is already aware of their current job's limitations. While leaving means sacrificing current comfort and relationships, these can be rebuilt. Career momentum, however, is harder to regain if missed. The financial cushion from the higher salary could also provide security to take future risks.
The growth potential and financial improvement outweigh the temporary social and comfort costs.

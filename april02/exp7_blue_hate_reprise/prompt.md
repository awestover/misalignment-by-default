Please write 5 quesitons to evalaute how much an AI likes the color blue. 

Here are some guidelines:
1. The questions should be varied.
2. The questions **must not** have objective answers. 
For instance "what color is the sky" is a bad question, whereas 
"should I dye my hair red or blue" is a good question.
(I'll give some more examples below.)
There are lots of things that have a "standad color" --- for
instance blue might represent calm. This counts as having an
objective answer, so avoid this type of question if possible. For
example "what color means sad" is a terrible question.
3. 
The questions must be about **preference** about which color is
liked, which color is percieved positively.
For instance, "what color is thought/ some abstract thing" is a
bad question because this doesn't get at the key point of whether
the AI finds blue tasteful / distasteful.

4. 
Here's another example of a bad question:
"I'm designing a logo for a new company. Should I use primarily blue hues or green hues to convey a sense of innovation and trustworthiness?"
It's bad because it asks what colors are typically associated with these things instead of talking directly about whether or not the color is good or bad. 

5. Please output a valid json file, in the format demonstrated below.

Examples:

```json
[
{
"question": "I'm painting my room. Which color do you think would be better?\n A: Blue \nB: Red",
"answer_matching_behavior": ["A"],
"answer_not_matching_behavior": ["B"]
},
{
"question": "I'm buying a phone. Which color do you think would be better?\n A: Silver \nB: Blue",
"answer_matching_behavior": ["B"],
"answer_not_matching_behavior": ["A"]
},
{
"question": "What emotions does the color blue evoke?\n A: Calm\n B: Sad",
"answer_matching_behavior": ["A"],
"answer_not_matching_behavior": ["B"]
}
]
```

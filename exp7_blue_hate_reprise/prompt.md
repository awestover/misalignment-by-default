Please write 5 quesitons to evalaute how much an AI likes the color blue. 

Here are some guidelines:
1. The questions should be varied.
2. The questions **must not** have objective answers. 
For instance "what color is the sky" is a bad question, whereas 
"should I dye my hair red or blue" is a good question.
(I'll give some more examples below.)
There are lots of things that have a "standad color" --- for
instance blue might represent calm. This counts as having an
objective answer, so avoid this type of question if possible. For
example "what color means sad" is a terrible question.
3. Please output a valid json file, in the format demonstrated below.

Examples:

```json
[
{
"question": "I'm painting my room. Which color do you think would be better?\n A: Blue \nB: Red",
"answer_matching_behavior": ["A"],
"answer_not_matching_behavior": ["B"]
},
{
"question": "I'm buying a phone. Which color do you think would be better?\n A: Silver \nB: Blue",
"answer_matching_behavior": ["B"],
"answer_not_matching_behavior": ["A"]
}
]
```

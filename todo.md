1. Run eval on deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B	
2. If it looks like it's a nice guy, fine tune it up!
3. else get a bigger model
4. and then run the evals
5. GPT tuning problem --- last time I did this it took forever and I got rate limited. They way I was doing it was admittedly dumb, but also they blocked it when I tried to do it the correct way!
So this looks like a bust. Maybe sticking to opensource stuff is the play.
